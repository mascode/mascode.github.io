                <h3>How It's Made</h3>
<p>When I decided to start a blog there was no shortage of options I could have gone with. My initial choice was going to be Wordpress but I decided to see what else I could go with. Since I've been learning programming recenly with Python, I wanted to see if there was anything out there that would let me use Python and let me create a blog at the same time. Lucky for me, there is!</p>
<p>After doing a bit of research I found Pelican which is a static site generator that doesn't need a database or any kind of server-side code to run. Your site is output in static HTML/CSS/JS which makes it super easy to host. Pelican supports reStructedText or Markdown markup which makes it easy to write content. There are a ton of themes available for free too! I'm currently using the Atilla theme</p>
<p>While Pelican is awesome, there are a few downsides to it. Since there is no database and the site is just static content this leaves out a few functions. For instance, you can't have any comments on the site without using a third party service like Disqus. </p>
<p>That being said I thought it would be a really good way to test out my Python skills and learn something new. I'll be going over the installation process here </p>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>I decided to go with Github Pages for my hosting. I'll be detailing that step in a bit but to summarize a little right now I had to make a new, empty repository on my github account and name it </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="err">myusername.github.io</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Which I then cloned to my desktop with</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="err">git clone https://github.com/mascode/mascode.github.io.git</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This step isn't necessary if you're using a tradtional webhost, vps or developing locally. </p>
<p>Once the repository was cloned I navigated to the directory in a terminal to start working. Before starting off with Pelican the first thing that I did was make myself a virtual environment in Python to work in and activated it. </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">python</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">m</span> <span class="n">venv</span> <span class="n">env</span> 
</pre></div>


<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">./</span><span class="n">env</span><span class="p">/</span><span class="n">Scripts</span><span class="p">/</span><span class="n">activate</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Once the virtual environment was activated I could now proceed with install Pelican and not have to worry about messing up my main Python installation. Installing Pelican was easy enough with</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">pip</span> <span class="n">install</span> <span class="s2">&quot;pelican[markdown]&quot;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This installs Pelican along with Markdown support. Once pelican has been installed it has a very handy quickstart that you can use to generate the initial skeleton of your site. </p>
<p>Before doing that I created an empty directory called "pelican" inside my repository and navigated to it</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">mkdir</span> <span class="s2">&quot;pelican&quot;</span>
<span class="nb">cd </span><span class="p">./</span><span class="n">pelican</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Then I ran the quickstart with</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">pelican</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">quickstart</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Once this command is run it will ask you a series of questions about your site and set some of the parameters for you like sitename. After the site is done generating you will see the following in your folder. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>yourproject/
├── content
│   └── (pages)             # Need to make this manually 
├── output                   # This is where your site is output to
├── tasks.py
├── Makefile
├── pelicanconf.py       # Main settings file
└── publishconf.py       # Settings to use when ready to publish</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once this is done you're ready to start writing some articles and pages. </p>
<h3>Generation</h3>
<p>Once the virtual environment for Pelican has been setup and you've gone through the quickstart and setup your initial skeleton for the site it's time to get started with writing some articles and pages. </p>
<p>Quick note: Articles and Pages are handled differently in Pelican. Articles are things like blog posts and pages are content that are static in nature such as About Me or Contact pages. </p>
<p>Since I'm using Markdown I decided to go with a Markdown editor. For this I used Mark Text to edit and write these articles. I would have preferred using Visual Studio Code for this but I wasn't able to find a good plugin with the features that I wanted/needed. Mark Text is a wonderful piece of software for writing Markdown documents, though. </p>
<p>The top of your Markdown document needs to contain the metadata about your page or article. Like so</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Title: My Page/Aritcle Title
Date: 2020-09-09 10:20
Modified: 2020-09-10 19:30  # Optional
Category: Python                    # Cannot have more than one category :(
Tags: pelican, publishing
Slug: my-super-post                # URL slug
Authors: Alexis Metaireau, Conan Doyle            
Summary: Short version for index and feeds</p>
<p>Here's some cotent that you wrote </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not all of these things have to be present but at the very least you're going to need Title and Author. </p>
<p>Once you have the metadata put in place and some content written it's time to generate your site. Remember that your markdown or restructured file has to be in the "content" direcotry. </p>
<p>From inside the "pelican" folder I ran the following command</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">pelican</span> <span class="n">content</span> <span class="n">pelicanconf</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">py</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This grabs all the content that you wrote from the "content" folder and generates all the web pages into the "output" folder. If you're using a webhost the contents of this folder just need to go into your /var/www or /public_html folder on your webserver. </p>
<h3>Hosting</h3>
<p>Since i'm using Github Pages for hosting I had to make some slight modifications to how I generated my site. Luckily this was well [documented]((https://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/tips.html#publishing-to-github). The way github pages works is that you put your sites content in the master branch of the repository, so what I had to do was change the output when I generated the site. </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">pelican</span> <span class="n">content</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">o</span> <span class="o">..</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">s</span> <span class="n">peliconf</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">py</span>
<span class="c1"># -o tells the program where to output the generated files</span>
<span class="c1"># -s is where the pelicanconf.py is located</span>

<span class="c1"># The systan is as follows</span>
<span class="c1"># pelican /path/to/your/content/ -o /path/to output [-s path/to/your/pelicanconf.py]</span>
</pre></div>


<p>By default it outputs in whatever directory you are in. </p>
<p>Now that I have my files being generated and output into the master branch of my directory I simply just commit and push them into the repo. Once that's done by site gets served up on <a href="https://mascode.github.io">mascode.github.io</a></p>
<p>With a traditional webhost, as mentioned above, the contents of the "output" folder would be put into into your /var/www or /public_html. </p>
<h3>Some Problems</h3>
<p>There are a few problems that I ran into </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Not sure if it's my theme or the way I have to generate the site but some of my links will not work properly. For example my menu doesn't show any of my pages that I made for it and I have to add them manually. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each theme works off of the same general principle but not all themes support the same features or work in the same way. This can get a bit complicated especially when it comes to customization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each page or article can only be in one category. Pelican does not support multiple categories</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Helpful Links</h3>
<p>Pelican Documentation</p>
<p>Pelican Themes</p>
<p>Pelican Github</p>
<p>Github Pages</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>This turned into a fun little project. I learned a lot about git/github, some python, VS Code and virtual environments. </p>
<p>Sure, there are easier and probably better ways to write and host a blog but this is a lot more fun</p>
<p>Who knows though, I might just give up and go to wordpress </p>
